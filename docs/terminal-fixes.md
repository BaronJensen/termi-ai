# Terminal Interaction Fixes

## Problem Identified

The terminal was going idle because:

1. **Missing `node-pty` dependency**: The native module wasn't properly installed, causing fallback to basic `child_process.spawn`
2. **Incomplete process management**: Processes weren't being properly cleaned up, leading to zombie processes
3. **Missing timeout handling**: No idle timeout detection for hanging processes
4. **Poor error recovery**: Limited fallback mechanisms when PTY failed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Dependencies

- ✅ Installed `node-pty` properly
- ✅ Added `@electron/rebuild` for native module compatibility
- ✅ Added rebuild script: `npm run rebuild`

### 2. Improved Process Management

- ✅ Added proper cleanup on app shutdown
- ✅ Added signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- ✅ Better process termination with fallback methods
- ✅ Cleanup of existing processes before starting new ones

### 3. Enhanced Timeout Handling

- ✅ Added idle timeout (30 seconds of no output)
- ✅ Added overall timeout (3 minutes default)
- ✅ Added terminal timeout (5 minutes for persistent terminals)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when timeouts occur

### 4. Better Error Handling

- ✅ Graceful fallback from PTY to spawn
- ✅ Improved error messages with actionable guidance
- ✅ Debug panel showing terminal status
- ✅ Force cleanup button for stuck processes

### 5. Debug Features

- ✅ Terminal status monitoring
- ✅ Process count tracking
- ✅ Force cleanup functionality
- ✅ Better logging throughout the system

## How to Use

### Normal Operation

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. The terminal should now work properly with `node-pty`
3. Commands will execute and show real-time output

### If Issues Occur

1. **Check the debug panel** at the top of the chat
2. **Use Force Cleanup** if process count is high (>2)
3. **Check terminal status** for any error indicators

### Debug Commands

- **Terminal Status**: Shows current terminal state and process count
- **Force Cleanup**: Kills all active processes (use when stuck)

## Technical Details

### PTY vs Spawn Fallback

- **Primary**: Uses `node-pty` for full terminal emulation
- **Fallback**: Falls back to `child_process.spawn` if PTY fails
- **Automatic**: System automatically chooses the best available method

### Timeout Configuration

- **Idle Timeout**: 30 seconds of no output
- **Process Timeout**: 3 minutes total execution time
- **Terminal Timeout**: 5 minutes for persistent terminals

### Process Cleanup

- **Automatic**: Cleanup on process completion/error
- **Manual**: Force cleanup via debug panel
- **Shutdown**: Cleanup on app exit

## Troubleshooting

### If Terminal Still Hangs

1. Check if `node-pty` is properly rebuilt: `npm run rebuild`
2. Verify cursor-agent is accessible: `which cursor-agent`
3. Check Electron version compatibility
4. Use Force Cleanup to clear stuck processes

### If PTY Fails

1. The system will automatically fall back to spawn
2. Check console logs for PTY error messages
3. Verify native module compilation

### Performance Issues

1. Monitor process count in debug panel
2. Use Force Cleanup if count gets high
3. Restart app if issues persist

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add process monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Implement process queuing for better resource management
- [ ] Add configurable timeout values
- [ ] Better integration with cursor-agent's interactive features
